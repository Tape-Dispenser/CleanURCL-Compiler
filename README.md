CleanURCL is a fork of URCL which aims to clean up messy aspects, as well as focus towards real world applications. As such, slightly more complex features are added. Documentation for CleanURCL can be found at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yNtomaHZZZFaMhCzPl6bZmT2d3U1xaDzE8gBgOLMYxc/edit?usp=sharing, as well as port documentation at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169oq5VcNYA_AL6kI8bPbXF0hs23YzY1nA8yA58zdGx8/edit?usp=sharing. Ports will be overhauled in the near future. If you want more info on URCL in general, join the URCL discord at https://discord.gg/Nv8jzWg5j8
